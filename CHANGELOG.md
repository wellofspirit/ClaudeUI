## 2026-03-04

### fix: pass model parameter through session creation flow (`db4e59d`)
- Added optional `model` parameter to `createSession()` across the full chain: `ClaudeAPI` interface → preload → IPC handler → `SessionManager.create()` → `ClaudeSession` constructor
- `InputBox.handleSend()` now passes `session.selectedModel` so the first query uses the correct model instead of defaulting then switching via `setModel()`

### chore: upgrade @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk to 0.2.63 and add test harnesses (`bd63b97`)
- Bumped SDK from 0.2.59 to 0.2.63 (CLI 2.1.63)
- Created `patch/test-helpers.mjs` (108 lines) — shared test infrastructure for spawning SDK sessions, waiting for events, asserting results
- Created `patch/mcp-test-server.mjs` (107 lines) — mock MCP server for testing MCP patches
- Added test harnesses for `mcp-status`, `mcp-tool-refresh`, and `queue-control` patches
- Updated `subagent-streaming/test.mjs` with improved assertions
- Fixed `mcp-tool-refresh/apply.mjs` regex patterns for 0.2.63 minified names

### feat: add patch-test-harness skill documentation (`c83abdf`)
- Created `.claude/skills/patch-test-harness/SKILL.md` (294 lines) — guides agents through writing behavioral tests for SDK patches

### feat: add patch-readme skill documentation (`7c7dc46`)
- Created `.claude/skills/patch-readme/SKILL.md` (404 lines) — guides agents through writing reverse-engineering READMEs for SDK patches

### feat: add sandbox configuration support with violation reporting (`867ad3e`)
- Created sandbox settings UI in `SettingsDialog.tsx` — enable/disable toggle, auto-allow bash, excluded commands list, network settings (restrict domains, allow local binding, unix sockets), filesystem settings (allow-write, deny-write, deny-read paths)
- Created `InfoTooltip` component and `SandboxListSetting` component for managing configurable string lists
- Added `SandboxSettings` type and `sandboxConfig` to `ClaudeSession` — passes full sandbox config to SDK `sdkQuery()` options
- Added sandbox violation detection: parses `<sandbox_violations>` XML from tool results, sends `session:sandbox-violation` IPC events
- Created `SandboxViolationToast.tsx` — ephemeral floating toast for violation notifications
- Added `sandboxSettings`, `sandboxViolations` to session store with related actions

### feat: support permission suggestions in approval workflow (`42064cf`)
- Created `PermissionSuggestions.tsx` (94 lines) — `AlwaysAllowSection` checkbox list with `formatSuggestionLabel()` producing human-readable labels for rule types (setMode, addRules, removeRules, addDirectories, etc.) and redundancy detection
- `FloatingApproval.tsx` and `ToolCallBlock.tsx` both show permission suggestion checkboxes above Allow/Deny buttons
- Selected suggestions sent back via `respondApproval()` and applied by `claude-session.ts` via `applyPermissionSuggestion()`
- Extended `PendingApproval` type with `suggestions` field; extended `ClaudeAPI.respondApproval()` with optional suggestions parameter

### feat: add sandbox-network-fix patch (`17adb59`, `8d5c1d3`)
- Created `patch/sandbox-network-fix/` — fixes SDK sandbox network proxy always starting even when no domain restrictions configured, blocking all traffic through an unnecessary proxy
- Patch modifies proxy startup check to skip initialization when `allowedDomains` includes `"*"` (unrestricted)
- Session-side fix: when `restrictNetwork` is false, omits `network` key entirely from sandbox config so SDK doesn't start domain filtering
- Initially named `network-unrestrict`, renamed to `sandbox-network-fix` with test harness and updated CLAUDE.md patch table

### feat: big refactor to improve code quality (`6a7b1dc`)
- Extracted `hooks/useFileMention.ts` (300 lines) — @ mention autocomplete logic with directory navigation, filtering, keyboard handling, and text insertion pulled out of InputBox
- Extracted `hooks/useSlashMenu.ts` (94 lines) — slash command popup state, filtering, keyboard navigation pulled out of InputBox
- Extracted `utils/content-blocks.ts` (45 lines) — `mergeContentBlocks()` for SDK partial message upsert, preserving tool_use/tool_result blocks across updates, pulled out of session store
- Extracted `utils/ipc-timeout.ts` (21 lines) — `withTimeout()` helper racing IPC calls against configurable timeouts
- Extracted `components/chat/FileAttachmentBar.tsx` (42 lines) — attachment preview bar pulled out of InputBox
- Simplified `preload/index.ts` from ~256 to ~100 lines by extracting IPC event registration into typed helpers
- Restructured `session.ipc.ts` handler registration with consistent error handling
- Reorganized `shared/types.ts` — reordered and grouped related interfaces
- `InputBox.tsx` shrunk dramatically; `SubagentMessages.tsx` simplified rendering; `MessageBubble.tsx` improved tool_use block grouping

### refactor: use isAgentTool helper for Task→Agent tool rename (`a828c16`)
- SDK 0.2.63 renamed `Task` tool to `Agent` (with `Task` as backward-compat alias); model may send either name
- Added `isAgentTool(toolName)` helper in `shared/types.ts` returning true for both `'Agent'` and `'Task'`
- Updated `MessageBubble.tsx` to route both tool names to `<TaskCard>` instead of only `'Task'`
- Updated `ToolCallBlock.tsx` `getSummary()` — handles `Agent`/`Task` → description; added `TaskOutput` → task ID, `TaskStop` → task ID
- Updated teammate detection in `claude-session.ts` and `session-history.ts` to match both tool names
- Updated `PermissionsDialog.tsx` template from `'Task'` to `'Agent'`; updated `AutomationConfig.tsx` default permission

### feat: expose background task feature via SDK control message API (`27cb695`)
- Created `patch/background-task/` — exposes the CLI's `ctrl+b` "send to background" feature via the SDK control message protocol
- **Part A** (`cli.js`): Added `background_task` control request handler accepting `tool_use_id`, searching tasks by `.toolUseId` property. For bash: calls `shellCommand.background()` (spills stdout to disk), sets `isBackgrounded`. For agents: sets `isBackgrounded`, resolves `backgroundSignal` Promise from `Ff6` Map
- **Part B** (`sdk.mjs`): Added `backgroundTask(toolUseId)` method on the Query class
- Six minified symbols (`errorFn`, `msgVar`, `successFn`, `getAppStateFn`/`setAppStateFn`, `wiFn`, `yiFn`, `bgSignalMap`) extracted dynamically from content patterns
- Added `backgroundTask()` to `ClaudeAPI` interface, preload bridge, IPC handler, and `ClaudeSession`
- `ToolCallBlock.tsx` shows "Send to background" button for foreground running Bash commands with accent border
- `TaskCard.tsx` shows "Send to background" button for foreground running Agent tasks
- Uses `tool_use_id` lookup (not `task_id`) because foreground tasks haven't returned results yet — `taskIdMap` is only populated by `detectTaskMapping()` on tool results

### refactor: improve clarity of background task UI labels (`0167d23`)
- Changed button text from "Background" to "Send to background" and spinner text from "backgrounding…" to "sending to background…" in `ToolCallBlock.tsx` and `TaskCard.tsx`

## 2026-03-03

### feat: add plan review panel with inline commenting (`6e73522`)
- Created `PlanReviewPanel.tsx` (174 lines) — a resizable right panel (500px default, 350–900px range) that splits plan content into sections at double-newline boundaries, each rendered as markdown
- Created `PlanCommentWidget.tsx` (106 lines) — inline widget for adding comments with quoted selection text, textarea, Cmd+Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- Created `PlanCommentBadge.tsx` (135 lines) — displays existing comments with quoted selection, edit/remove on hover, accent-colored left border
- Created `PlanReviewBar.tsx` (88 lines) — bottom bar showing comment count and "Send Comments" button that composes all comments into structured feedback sent as a `deny` approval response
- Created `useTextSelectionComment.ts` hook (177 lines) — detects text selection within plan content, strips markdown syntax for fuzzy matching, maps rendered text back to source line numbers
- Added `planReview` per-session state with `openPlanPanel`, `closePlanPanel`, `addPlanComment`, `updatePlanComment`, `removePlanComment` store actions
- `ExitPlanModeCard` now has a "Review" button that opens the plan panel with plan content and approval request ID
- `ReviewBar` (git diff) gained Cmd+Shift+Enter keyboard shortcut for sending comments

### fix: improve context menu layout consistency (`d53e2b0`)
- Standardized context menu containers in `Sidebar.tsx` and `GitFileTree.tsx` — replaced `min-w-[160px]` with `grid` layout so items stretch to equal widths without a fixed min-width

### feat: add file discard functionality with context menu (`713a59f`)
- Added `GitService.discardFile()` — runs `git checkout HEAD -- <file>` for tracked files; detects untracked files via `git show HEAD:<file>` failure and deletes them from disk
- Added `git:discard-file` IPC channel and preload API
- Expanded `GitFileTree` context menu: right-click shows "Stage"/"Unstage" toggle and "Discard changes"/"Delete file" for individual files, plus "Discard changes (N files)" for directories
- Added confirmation dialog for destructive discard operations with "This action cannot be undone" warning, rendered via portal with backdrop blur
- Updated `--color-bg-hover` CSS variables across dark, light, and monokai themes for better hover feedback

### docs: add ADR-002 and ADR-003 for terminal panel persistence and cwd grouping (`13e3a27`)
- **ADR-002:** Always mount `TerminalPanel` in the DOM (`display: contents/none`) to preserve xterm.js scrollback buffers — changed from conditional rendering
- **ADR-003:** Group terminal tabs by session cwd with 10-minute cold cleanup for orphaned groups
- Refactored store from flat `terminalTabs`/`activeTerminalId` to `terminalGroups: Record<string, { tabs, activeTabId }>` with per-group selectors
- Created `useTerminalColdCleanup.ts` hook (58 lines) — starts 10-minute timer when a terminal group has no active session, then kills PTYs and removes the group
- Added `PtyManager.killByCwd()` method exposed via `terminal:kill-by-cwd` IPC
- Added session inactivity timeout (default 15 min) with configurable dropdown in SettingsDialog (5/15/30/60 min or Never)

### feat: add architectural decision records system and preserve @ mentions in prompts (`2920ceb`)
- Added ADR framework to `CLAUDE.md` with guidance to check for superseding decisions
- Created `doc/adr.md` registry index and `doc/adr-001_preserve-at-mentions-in-user-prompt.md`
- Fixed `InputBox` @ mention insertion: paths with spaces become `@"path with spaces"` (quoted), simple paths become `@path` (unquoted)

## 2026-03-02

### Support worktree and fix displaced collapse sidebar button on different zoom level (`2fc507b`)
- Created `worktree.ts` service (161 lines) with `createWorktree`, `getWorktreeStatus`, `removeWorktree`, `listWorktrees` — creates worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/<name>`, copies `settings.local.json`, configures git hooks path
- Reworked app quit lifecycle: `before-quit` now prevents default, sends `app:before-quit` to renderer, with 5-second fallback timeout for worktree cleanup prompts
- Created three new modals: `QuitWorktreeModal` (keep all/remove all on quit), `WorktreeCleanupModal` (per-session worktree cleanup with status), `WorktreesModal` (list all worktrees with individual remove)
- Created `WorktreePill.tsx` — pill shown in ChatPanel header when in a worktree, showing name and branch
- **Zoom fix:** Sidebar collapse button now divides position by `uiFontScale`, context menu positions also zoom-adjusted via `contextMenuPosition()` helper
- Git service bugfix: added `stat.isFile()` check before reading untracked files

### feat: add git push with upstream tracking support (`e6c8a09`)
- Added `GitService.pushWithUpstream(branch)` — runs `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>`
- Push button no longer disabled when there's no upstream tracking; shows inline "Push with -u" prompt on upstream errors
- Consolidated `GitCommitBox` error/feedback into a `toast` object with `{ message, type: 'success' | 'error' }`, error toasts display for 5 seconds (vs 2.5s for success)

- Refactored InputBox @ mention logic with improved directory listing integration

### refactor: downgrade info logs to debug level for verbose operations (`2971dd2`)
- Added `debug()` method to logger with `debugEnabled` flag (default false) — debug messages only go to console, never to log file
